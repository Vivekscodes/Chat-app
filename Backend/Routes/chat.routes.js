Here are some improvements to the given code:

```python
def get_maximum_profit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    This function returns the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling
    a single stock in a given list of prices.

    :param prices: A list of integers representing the daily prices of a stock.
    :return: The maximum profit that can be made.
    """
    if len(prices) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must contain at least two prices")

    min_price = prices[0]  # Initialize the minimum price seen so far
    max_profit = 0  # Initialize the maximum profit seen so far

    for price in prices[1:]:
        # Update the minimum price seen so far if the current price is lower
        min_price = min(min_price, price)

        # Calculate the potential profit from buying at the minimum price and selling at the current price
        potential_profit = price - min_price

        # Update the maximum profit seen so far if the potential profit is higher
        max_profit = max(max_profit, potential_profit)

    return max_profit
```

I added comments to explain the purpose of the function and the variables used. I also added type hints for the input and output types. I fixed a bug where the function would return 0 instead of raising an error when given an empty or one-element list. I also simplified the logic by using the built-in `min` and `max` functions instead of manually tracking the minimum and maximum values. Finally, I renamed the variables to be more descriptive of their purpose.
